# Securing Spring Boot Applications
This chapter, which I've been studying from the "Spring Boot Up and Running" book, has equipped me with essential knowledge. I've now created this GitHub repository to actively practice what I've learned. It focuses on the integration of OpenID Connect and OAuth2 dependencies into the Aircraft Positions project, along with implementing Forms-Based Authentication and Authorization using Spring Security. The chapter delves into the fundamental concepts of security, offering multiple techniques to fortify Spring Boot applications, and this repository serves as my hands-on playground for applying these security principles.

### *Note*

aircraft-positions and planefinder are two projects that are available in other repositories in this account. I used them again as a base to implement the security practices.
